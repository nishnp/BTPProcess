# Setup of the SAP S/4HANA on-premise System

## Introduction

In this section we learn how to activate an API oData service in a SAP S/4HANA on-premise system, create a user and assign the necessary roles and authorization objects.

**Persona:** S/4HANA Administrator

## Step-by-Step

***Hint:** The following screenshots are done with SAP GUI 7.50 - by using SAP GUI 7.60 the usage could differ e.g tick button instead of a continue button etc.*

### Activate oData Service
1. Logon S/4HANA system using SAP GUI with your adminstrator user.
2. Call transaction /n/IWFND/MAINT_SERVICE.
3. Click on **Add Service**

   ![Add Service](./images/add-service.png)

   1. System Alias = LOCAL
   2. Technical Service Name = API_BU*
   3. Press enter - you should see the API_BUSINESS_PARTNER in the list box.

    1. Double-click on ZAPI_BUSINESS_PARTNER
    2. Click on Call Browser
   
    ![Test Bupa](./images/test-bupa1.png)
    
    Hint: If you use a CAL system, kindly check and use the relevant IP address instead of the default system host name as the host name has to be resolvable by the browser.

* Enter the credentials of the user we have created. You should then see the structure of the BusinessPartner oData service.

    ![Test Bupa](./images/test-bupa2.png)

*  Change the end ot the URL to ..../sap/API_BUSINESS_PARTNER/A_BusinessPartner/?$format=xml. You should now see a list of Business Partners.

This completes this mission section.



## Summary

You have activated an API in the S/4 on-premise system and created a user with the necessary roles for CRUD operations of Business Partner data and to access the API_BUSINESS_PARTNER_SRV oData service.

***Hint:** the simplest way for adding additional users with the same roles is just to copy this user profile in the SU01 transaction*
