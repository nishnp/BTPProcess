# Setup SAP Cloud Connector and establish a Trust to the SAP S/4HANA System

## Introduction

In this section we setup the SAP Cloud Connector and create the certificate for secure connection with Principal Propagation to the SAP S/4HANA system by establishing a trusted relationship between them.

**Persona:** SAP S/4HANA Administrator


## Step-by-step Setup
### **A: Installation**

For the installation of the SAP Cloud Connector please follow the steps in the SAP Help document - for this mission the Portable Scenario would be sufficient.

[SAP Help: Cloud Connector Installation](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/57ae3d62f63440f7952e57bfcef948d3.html)

### **B: Certificate Setup** 
To establish a secure connection between your SAP S/4HANA system and the cloud connector, a trusted relationship must be established. For a SSO communication with principal propagation an intermediate certificate is issued. In this guide, we will use custom certficates for this setup. For a productive usage, it is recommended to use a certificate signed by the trusted certificate authorization of your company.


1. Login to SAP Cloud Connector with the administrator user you have created at the installation.
   
   1.  Click on Configuration in the Menu.
   2.  Click on the **On Premise** tab.
   3.  Click on the the icon **Create and import a self-signed certificate** in the section System Certificate.

2. In the **Create Self-signed Certificate** window enter the following:
   1. Common Name(CN) eg.: **REFAPPS**
   2. Enter Locality(L) eg.: **Your City**
   3. Organization(o) eg.: **Your Company**
   4. Country(c) eg.: **DE** 
   5. Click on Create
   
   ![Create Self Signed Certificate](./images/CertificateCloudConnector2.png)

3. Once the self-signed certificate is created, look in the **Configuration** screen and click on **Download certificate in DER format** icon in **System Certificate** section. We will use this certificate in a later step to establish the trust between the SAP Cloud Connector and the SAP S/4HANA system.

4. Create a CA Certificate
   1. Scroll-down to the CA Certificate section and click on **Create and import a self-signed certificate**
  
   Enter the following values:

   2. Common Name(CN) eg.: **REFAPPS**
   3. Enter Locality(L) eg.: **Your City**
   4. Organization(o) eg.: **Your Company**
   5. Country(c) eg.: **DE** 
   6. Click on Create

5. Setup Principal Propagation
   1. Scroll down to the Principal Propagation section and click on the Edit icon
   2. In the Common Name (CN) field set ${email} as value. 
   
   ***Hint:** the field entry must be ${email} don't use the ${mail} entry from the dropdown box* 
   3. For the other fields keep the default values - press Save

### **C: Create Trust to SAP Cloud Connector and configure Principal Propagation in the SAP S/4HANA System**

***Hint:** The following screenshots are done with SAP GUI 7.50 - by using SAP GUI 7.60 the usage could differ e.g tick button instead of a continue button etc.*

1. Logon to your SAP S/4HANA with SAP GUI
2. Call Transaction STRUST
   1. Click on **Display/Change** icon to Edit mode
   2. Click on **SSL Server standard**
   3. If no sub-folders are present, right click and Create
   4. Scroll down to certificate and click on **Import certificate** icon
   
   ![STRUST](./images/S4PrincipalPropagation1.png)

3. Upload Certificate
   1. Under the tab 'File', choose the file path of **sys_Cert.DER** file which you have download from the SAP Cloud Connector System certificate step 3.
   2. Click **Ok** and confirm
   3. Click on **Add to Certificate List** button
   4. Click on **Save** button
